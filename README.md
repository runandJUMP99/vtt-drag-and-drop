Thank you so much again for the opportunity! I am looking forward to hearing back from you on this small project.

I am excited for the chance to show you more of what I can do, and I truly feel like I would make a great fit. I have the required skills you are looking for, plus I am always setting goals for myself and looking to improve everyday.

I'm currently looking to add to my skills and am studying for the DevOps Engineer AWS Certification. I also make games on the side for fun with Unity and C# (check out Cuppy's on Steam!üç¶).

Lastly, not only do I have 3 years of professional programming experience, I am self-taught, and also have 5 years of work from home experience, so docs don't scare me!üí™

Thanks again for your time, and hope to hear from you soon!
